# King County House Price Prediction

## Project Overview

This project analyzes house sales data from King County, USA, to build predictive models for house prices. The workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, model building using linear and polynomial regression, evaluation, and business insights.

## Goals

- Identify key factors that impact house prices
- Compare the performance of linear and polynomial regression models
- Support data-driven real estate pricing and investment decisions

## Key Features

- Comprehensive EDA with correlation analysis and distribution plots
- Feature engineering and selection based on correlations
- Linear regression and polynomial regression (degree 2) modeling
- Evaluation using R² score and RMSE
- Residual and actual vs. predicted plots for model validation
- Business-focused interpretation of results

## Files

- `King_County_House_Price_Prediction.ipynb`: Main analysis notebook containing all code and visualizations
- `README.md`: Project overview and documentation

## Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results

- Linear Regression: R² ≈ 0.65, RMSE ≈ \$247,000
- Polynomial Regression: R² ≈ 0.76, RMSE ≈ \$202,000

Polynomial regression improved prediction accuracy but comes with increased model complexity, which may affect interpretability.
